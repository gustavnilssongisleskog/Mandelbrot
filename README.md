# Mandelbrot viewer #
This is a program for visualizing both the Mandelbrot set and quadratic Julia sets. The program can be run using sbt (Scala build tools), which you can download from here: https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html 

## Controls
- Left click to zoom in on a fractal
- Right click to zoom out from a fractal
- Scroll wheel click to move within a fractal
- Space, J or any other mouse click will create a new quadratic Julia set from the complex number that the cursor is currently on
